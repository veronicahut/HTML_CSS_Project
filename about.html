        <p>
            My programming journey began when I returned to school to study computer science while 
            working part-time as an environmental lab technician. I later transitioned into a full-time 
            role as a data technician in the IT department of the same company. After earning a certificate 
            as a programmer-analyst, I was promoted to IT Specialist and eventually to IT Project Manager. 
            I then chose to pursue an A.B. degree in Computer Programming while continuing to work full time. 
            When I learned that my position would be eliminated, I decided to follow my passion and pursue 
            a career as a computer programmer.

            I enjoy developing applications and designing intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. I'm passionate 
            about solving problems creatively and fostering positive experiences for users. I strive to create 
            interfaces that leave users feeling confident and satisfied with their experience. I also have a 
            strong appreciation for learning new platforms, tools, and programming languages. 
        </p>

            My work experience includes developing .NET applications that transform data into specific 
            deliverable formats, as well as student projects involving both software development and 
            interface design using various languages and IDEs. I have thrived both independently and as 
            part of a team. While working remotely, I was able to maintain focus and productivity, and 
            I've also collaborated successfully in academic and professional environments.
        </p> 
        <p>
            I love problem-solving and the challenges and rewards it brings. I draw inspiration from 
            nature and outdoor activities. In my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, reading, baking, 
            spending time with my family, and traveling.
