        <p>
            My programming journey began when I returned to school 
            to study this topic while working as a part time environmental lab technician. 
            Remaining with the same company, I took a full time position as a data technician  
            in the IT department. I earned a certificate as a programmer-analyst and I was 
	    promoted to IT Specialist and then later to IT project manager. Deciding to return to 
	    school for an A.B. degree in computer programming, I worked full time while taking classes. 
	    Upon realizing that my position was going to be eliminated, I opted to follow my goals 
	    and search for a position as a computer programmer. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Work I like to do includes developing applications and designing user-friendly 
            interfaces. I enjoy using my creativity to solve problems and creating a positive environment. 
            I am interested in providing a user experience that leaves the users feeling confident 
            about their tasks and feeling good about their experience. I have an appreciation for learning 
	    new platforms and tools, as well as new languages. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Work I have done includes developing .NET applications to manipulate data 
            into specific deliverable formats and student projects in development and design 
	    with various programming languages and IDEs. 
            I have been successful working individually and with a team. When I worked from home, 
	    I was able to focus and stay on task. I alko have been able to effectively 
	    collaborate in various situations at school and work. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            I love problem solving and the challenges and rewards it brings. I get many inspirations 
	    from nature and being outdoors. Some of my hobbies include running, hiking, reading, 
	    and baking. I also enjoy spending time with my family 
            and traveling in my free time.
